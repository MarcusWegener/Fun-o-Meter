**‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:**  
This is a learning and demo project. It was created for the joy of learning and experimenting with real-time data processing, emotion recognition, and dashboarding.  
There is **no claim to correctness or completeness**, and **no liability** is accepted for any damage that may occur from using this code.

## üéØ Project Idea

This project was born out of the motivation to present a **live Power BI / Fabric dashboard** filled with real-time data during the **data:unplugged** event.

As passionate fans of both **Power BI / Microsoft Fabric** and **gaming**, we initially considered capturing gameplay data via **camera or HDMI capture** and analyzing it using **OCR** ‚Äì a kind of digital retrofit approach.

However, during a session at the **TDWI Barcamp**, someone pointed out:  
> *‚ÄúThese values are already visible in-game ‚Äì there's little added value.‚Äù*

üí° This shifted our perspective: Instead of focusing on game data, why not analyze **the players themselves**?

Inspired by platforms like **Twitch**, where viewers enjoy watching others play ‚Äì especially reacting emotionally ‚Äì we had a new idea:

üëâ **Let‚Äôs analyze the facial emotions of the players** in real time and integrate this into a live dashboard.

In this way, the player influences the dashboard not just through gameplay, but also through **emotions**!

## üß† Tech Stack & Tools

Thanks to powerful Python modules and a helpful push from ChatGPT, this idea quickly became a working prototype.

### Used Technologies:

- `Python 3`
- [`DeepFace`](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) for facial emotion analysis
- `OpenCV` for webcam input
- `Azure Event Hub` to stream real-time data
- `Power BI / Microsoft Fabric` for dashboarding

## üöÄ Getting Started

> ‚ö†Ô∏è I‚Äôm not (yet) a Python expert ‚Äì but here‚Äôs how I got it running:

### 1. Install Python  
You can install Python directly from the Microsoft Store.

---

### 2. Use Visual Studio Code + Python Extension  
I recommend using **Visual Studio Code** with the official **Python extension**.

---

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment  
Use separate environments for each Python project. The VS Code extension helps you create one easily:

### 4. Manually Install Missing Modules  
Not all modules were installed from `requirements.txt`, so I activated the `venv` and manually installed the missing ones:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install deepface
pip install azure-eventhub
pip install tf-keras
```

---

### 5. Connect to Azure Event Hub  
To stream the analyzed emotions into **Microsoft Fabric**, you need a connection string from an **Azure Event Hub**.  
You can configure it as a custom endpoint in an eventstream.
